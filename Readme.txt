-A python script to get stock ticker fundamentals from Yahoo finance for dividend paying companies and generate a CSV report to calculate total cash vs dept, earnings quarterly growth, Payout ratio, dividend yield vs 5-year dividend yield and dividend growth. Use example: Use the results in Excel/filters to finalize stock selection process for dividend aristocrats that could maintain consistent dividend growth in the foreseeable future.

-This script is dependent on yfinance library and if Yahoo changes the their data encryption/decryption  then this library requires upgrade so the script works:
$ pip install yfinance --upgrade --no-cache-dir


Disclaimer: this is not a financial advice, and data accuracy from Yahoo is not guaranteed.
